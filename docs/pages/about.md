title: About Me
---

I am Kraig, a Software Engineer and Tech enthusiast. I love reading about everything from PC hardware to the latest software advances on [/r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming). I love learning new things more than anything else. I am currently very interested in learning all aspects about functional programming in Scala and Haskell.

I love being outside with my dog, mountain biking, and hanging out with friends. My latest obsession is playing games in Virtual Reality with my [Oculus Rift](https://reddit.com/r/oculus).
